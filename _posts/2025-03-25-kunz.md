Consider, for a moment, the hexagon embedded in $\mathbb R^3$ with
vertices

$$
(1,2,3), \quad (1,3,2), \quad (3,1,2), \quad (3,2,1), \quad (2,3,1), \quad (2,1,3).
$$

Since these vertices lie in the hyperplane $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 6$, this
is indeed a “flat” (i.e., 2-dimensional) shape. The 2-dimensional
picture of the hexagon below is obtained by “looking at” the hexagon
from above this hyperplane.

Notice that each edge connects 2 vertices whenever their coordinates
differ by a transposition of two coordinates that differ by 1 (e.g.,
swapping the “2” and “3” in $(3,1,2)$ yields the adjacent vertex
$(2,1,3)$). If we instead label each vertex with the expression
“$a | b | c$” to indicate a 1 is placed in the $a$’th coordinate,
the 2 is placed in the $b$’th coordinate, and a 3 is placed in the
$c$’th coordinate (as shown in light blue above), we see each edge
corresponds to an adjacent transposition (this is known as the
*inverse* permutation to the one in the coordinates).

Let’s play the same game in one dimension higher. Consider the 24 points
in $\mathbb R^4$ obtained by permuting the coordinates of the point
$(1, 2, 3, 4)$. These all lie in the hyperplane
$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 10$, and form the vertices of a 3-dimensional
polyhedron, depicted below. Just as in the hexagon example above, if we
label each vertex with the inverse permutation, each edge corresponds to
an adjacent transposition. This shape is known as the *permutohedron*,
and there is one in each dimension: the $d-1$ dimensional
permutohedron lives in $\mathbb R^d$ and has $d!$ vertices, each
obtained by permuting the coordinates of the point
$(1, 2, \ldots, d)$.

</div>

The above examples illustrate an interesting phenomenon: the geometry of
the permutohedron naturally identifies adjacent transpositions as
important to the study of permutations. Moreover, the (geometric) fact
that any two vertices of a polyhedron are connected by a sequence of
edges yields a known fact from combinatorics: any two permutations
differ by a sequence of adjacent transpositions (or, stated
algebraically, adjacent transpositions generate the permutation group).
There are many other examples of this phenomenon, such as the
*hypercube* (whose vertices correspond to subsets of
$\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$) and the *associahedron* (a relative of the
permutohedron). In each of the polyhedra in these families, the vertices
are in bijective correspondence with a well-studied combinatorial
object, and the faces naturally highlight structural similarities
therein [[11]](#celebrateloday).

Kunz polyhedra, introduced in [[10]](#kunz), are another such family, one whose
corresponding combinatorial objects are numerical semigroups [[13]](#numerical)  (see blog entry [IV](https://dam-network.github.io/2024/05/04/wilf/)). In each dimension $m \ge 3$, there is a polyhedron
$P_m \subseteq \mathbb R^{m-1}$, shaped like a pointed cone, for which
each point in $P_m \cap \mathbb Z_{\ge 1}^{m-1}$ corresponds to a
numerical semigroup $S$ with smallest generator $m$. Let us begin
with the case $m = 3$, so that $P_3 \subseteq \mathbb R^2$ can be
easily drawn. This polyhedron is depicted below, and has bounding
inequalities $2x_1 \ge x_2$ and $2x_2 + 1 \ge x_1.$

<div align="center">

<img src="/public/img/kunz3.svg" style="height:2in" />

</div>

Each point $(x_1,x_2) \in P_3 \cap \mathbb Z_{\ge 1}^2$ corresponds to
the numerical semigroup

$$
S = \langle 3, 3x_1 + 1, 3x_2 + 2 \rangle.
$$

For example, the point $(5,4)$, which lies in the interior of $P_3$,
corresponds to
$S = \langle 3, 16, 14 \rangle = \langle 3, 14, 16 \rangle$, while the
point $(3,6)$, which lies on the upper boundary of $P_3$,
corresponds to
$S = \langle 3, 10, 20 \rangle = \langle 3, 10 \rangle$. The latter
example illustrates what makes the points on the boundary of $P_3$
special: their corresponding numerical semigroups have only 2 minimal
generators, while any point in the interior of $P_3$ corresponds to a
numerical semigroup with 3 minimal generators.

Now, let’s explore $P_4 \subseteq \mathbb R^3$, depicted below with
the cross section $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 12$ highlighted and the 4
bounding inequalities

$$
2x_1 \ge x_2, \qquad x_1 + x_2 \ge x_3, \qquad x_2 + x_3 + 1 \ge x_1 \qquad \text{and} \qquad 2x_3 + 1\ge x_2
$$

labeled on the respective sides they bound.

<div align="center">

<img src="/public/img/kunz4.svg" style="height:3in" />

</div>

Each integer point in the cross section corresponds to a numerical
semigroup (each having exactly 12 gaps) via the bijective correspondence

$$
(x_1, x_2, x_3) \in P_4 \cap \mathbb Z_{\ge 1}^3
\qquad \leftrightsquigarrow \qquad
S = \langle 4, 4x_1 + 1, 4x_2 + 2, 4x_3 + 3 \rangle.
$$

Of these 18 points, $(2,4,6)$ is the only one that lies on an extremal
ray, and it corresponds to the numerical semigroup
$S = \langle 4, 9 \rangle$ with 2 minimal generators. The remaining
boundary points are

$$
(3,6,3), \quad (5,5,2), \quad (5,1,6), \quad (4,2,6), \quad \text{and} \quad (3,3,6),
$$

each of which lives on a flat (i.e., 2-dimensional) face of $P_4$ but
not on an extremal ray, and each corresponds to a numerical semigroup
with exactly 3 minimal generators. The remaining 12 points in the cross
section correspond to numerical semigroups with 4 minimal generators
(the largest possible number of minimal generators when the smallest
generator is 4).

More generally, the integer points in
$P_m \cap \mathbb Z_{\ge 1}^{m-1}$ have a natural bijective
correspondence

$$
(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{m-1}) \in P_m \cap \mathbb Z_{\ge 1}^{m-1}
 \longmapsto 
S = \langle m, mx_1 + 1, mx_2 + 2, \ldots, mx_{m-1} + (m-1) \rangle
$$

to the numerical semigroups with smallest generator $m$. To see the
map in the reverse direction, given a numerical semigroup $S$, each
$x_i$ is chosen to equal the number of gaps of $S$ equivalent to
$i$ modulo $m$. Equivalently, one can require that for each $i$,
the value $a_i = mx_i + i \in S$ is the smallest element of $S$
equivalent to $i$ modulo $m$. For example, if
$S = \langle 6, 9, 20\rangle$ is the McNugget semigroup, one can check
that $a_0 = 0$, $a_1 = 49$, $a_2 = 20$, $a_3 = 9$, $a_4 = 40$,
and $a_5 = 29$ are the smallest elements of $S$ in their respective
equivalence classes modulo 6, meaning $S$ corresponds to the point
$(8,3,1,6,4) \in P_6$. As expected, there are exactly 3 gaps
equivalent to 2 modulo 6, namely $2, 8, 14 \notin S$, while
$3 \notin S$ is the only gap equivalent to 3 modulo 6. Additionally,
it is not a coincidence that $x_1 = 8$ is the largest coordinate and
the list $1, 7, 13, \ldots, 43 \notin S$ of gaps equivalent to 1
modulo 6 terminates with the Frobenius number of $S$. (The set
$\{0, a_1, \ldots, a_{m-1}\}$ is known as the *Apéry set* of $S$,
and plays a central role in computational problems).

We can also use this map to identify the inequalities of $P_m$.
Continue the notation from the previous paragraph, wherein each $a_i$
denotes the smallest element of $S$ equivalent to $i$ modulo $m$.
The key observation is that $a_i + a_j \in S$ is equivalent to $i+j$
modulo $m$, and thus must be at least as large as the smallest element
in that equiavlence class (either $a_{i+j}$ or $a_{i+j-m}$,
depending on whether or not $i+j < m$). This yields the general
definition of the *Kunz polyhdron* $P_m \subseteq \mathbb R^{m-1}$ via
bounding inequalities


$$
\begin{array}{rclll}
x_i + x_j &\ge& x_{i+j}
& \text{for} &
1 \le i \le j \le m-1
\qquad \text{with} \qquad
i + j < m,
\\
x_i + x_j + 1 &\ge& x_{i+j-m}
& \text{for} &
1 \le i \le j \le m-1
\qquad \text{with} \qquad
i + j > m,
\end{array}
$$

which coincides with the inequalities for $P_3$ and $P_4$ given
above. It turns out the only point satisfying every inequality above
with equality is
$(-\tfrac{1}{m}, -\tfrac{2}{m}, \ldots, -\tfrac{m-1}{m})$, which
implies $P_m$ is a pointed cone translated so that this rational point
is its vertex.

As hinted above, if two points lie on the same face of $P_m$, their
corresponding numerical semigroups have some algebraic and combinatorial
properties in common (e.g., the same number of minimal generators and
equal Betti numbers, as Kunz observed in [[10]](#kunz)). However, in recent years
there has been a surge of interest in studying Kunz polyhedra,
identifying connections to geometry [[1](#alhajjarkunz), [5](#kunzfaces4)], homological algebra [[4](#kunzfiniteres),[8](#kunzinfiniteres)], enumerative
combinatorics [[12](#kunzcoords),[6](#wilfmultiplicity)], and poset combinatorics [[2](#kunzfaces2),[7](#kunzfaces3),[9](#kunzfaces1),[3](#aperyfaces)]. As the Kunz polyhedron is
still relatively new, much of the connection between its geometric
structure and the numerical semigroups its points correspond to has yet
to be explored.
