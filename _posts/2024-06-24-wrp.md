Shortest path problems, where the goal is to find an optimal path
between two points in the plane, are among the fundamental problems in
computational geometry. These problems are crucial for a variety of
applications, GPS navigation is perhaps the best-known application.
However, there are numerous daily-life problems that can be solved using
shortest path algorithms. For another well-known example, robot vacuum
cleaners need to navigate through environments, avoiding obstacles and
reaching a target location efficiently. Also, in the realm of video game
development, creating realistic and challenging game worlds often
involves pathfinding for non-player characters.

The most general version of the shortest path problem considers a
subdivision of the two-dimensional plane into regions (see
Figure <a href="#fig:terrain" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:terrain">1</a>), where each region $R_i$ has a
weight $\omega_i \geq 0$ reflecting about how fast one can move inside
that region (or how costly it is to do so).

Back to the example of a robot vacuum cleaner, moving on a carpet is
more costly than on a hard floor. In general applications, the moving
object can have different speeds when traversing a road, a dirt track, a
forest, or a swamp area. Furthermore, the speeds may also depend on
other factors such as time of day, precipitation, or the location of
other bodies.

The resulting metric is called the *Weighted Region Metric*, and the
problem of computing a shortest path between two points under this
metric is known as the *Weighted Region Problem* (WRP) ([Mitchell and
Papadimitrou 1991](#ref-Mitchell2)). In this setting, a straight-line segment $\sigma$,
of Euclidean length $|\sigma|$, between two points in the same region
has weighted length $\omega_i \cdot \rvert \sigma \lvert$ when
traversing the interior of region $R_i$, or
$\min\{\omega_i,\omega_j\} \cdot\rvert \sigma \lvert$ if it goes along a
boundary shared by regions $R_i$ and $R_j$. Then, the weighted length of
a path $\pi(s,t)$ through a subdivision, denoted
by $\lVert \pi(s,t) \rVert$, is the sum of the weighted lengths of its
subpaths through each face or edge. The WRP entails computing a weighted
shortest path $\mathit{SP_w}(s,t)$ between two given points $s$ and $t$
under this metric.

It would be great if one could obtain a weighted shortest path exactly
and using a reasonable amount of time and space, but this problem seems
to be hard. In 2014, De Carufel et al. ([De Carufel et al. 2014](#ref-Lou)) proved
that computing an exact shortest path between two points using the
Weighted Region Metric—in its general formulation—is an unsolvable
problem in the Algebraic Computation Model over the Rational Numbers
($\mathit{ACM\mathbb{Q}}$). In the $\mathit{ACM\mathbb{Q}}$ model, one
can exactly compute any number that can be obtained from rational
numbers by applying a finite number of operations from
$+, -, \times, \div$, and $\sqrt[k]{}$, for any integer $k \geq 2$.

Therefore, in applications where the WRP arises, which usually require
efficient and practical algorithms, several approximation algorithms
have been proposed. The general idea of these algorithms is to
discretize the geometric space. One such technique, developed by
Mitchell and Papadimitriou in 1991 ([Mitchell and Papadimitrou 1991](#ref-Mitchell2)), is
based on the continuous Dijkstra’s algorithm, subdividing triangle edges
in parts for which crossing shortest paths have the same combinatorial
structure. Since the seminal work by Mitchell and Papadimitriou, several
approximate solutions were proposed, with improvements on running times,
and based on adding Steiner points on the boundary or inside the regions
(e.g., see ([Aleksandrov et al. 1998](#ref-Aleksandrov); [Aleksandrov, Maheshwari, and Sack
2000](#ref-Aleksandrov2), [2005](#ref-Aleksandrov3); [Bose, Esteban, and Maheshwari 2024](#ref-bose2024steiner); [Sun and Reif 2006](#ref-Sun))).
However, results on WRP typically keep some dependency on the vertex
coordinates sizes and weight ranges.

Yet another technique consists on approximating the domain by using a
(weighted) *tessellation* $\mathcal{T}$. See
Figure <a href="#fig:tessellation" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:tessellation">2</a>.

label="fig:tessellation"></span>

</figure>

Then, an approximation is considered by computing a shortest path on a
weighted graph associated to $\mathcal{T}$. Convex polygons, and
overlapping disks —of different sizes— are among the most frequently
used region shapes. Nonetheless, *regular meshes* are the dominant and
simplest shape representation scheme in computer graphics. In general,
regular meshes are easy to implement, and are a natural choice for
environments that are grid-based by design (e.g., many game designs). In
addition, some search and optimization algorithms can be optimized for
square ([Ammar et al. 2016](#ref-Ammar); [Nagy 2003](#ref-nagy)), or regular-hexagon
grids ([Björnsson et al. 2003](#ref-bjornsson2003comparison)).

Recently, Bose et al. ([Bose et al. 2022a](#ref-HexagonsYRF), [2022b](#ref-SquaresEuroCG), [2023](#ref-bose2023approximating)), as part of the
PhD thesis of Guillermo Esteban, studied how well a shortest path
computed on a weighted regular mesh approximates the actual shortest
path. In particular, comparing a shortest grid path
$\mathit{SGP_w}(s,t)$ in the graph where every corner of the mesh is
joined by an edge to a predefined set of $k$ neighbors, to the actual
shortest path $\mathit{SP_w}(s,t)$. See
Figure <a href="#fig:comparison" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:comparison">3</a> for a comparison between the two
types of shortest paths in a square tessellation.

<figure id="fig:comparison">
<img src="/public/img/cs.png" style="width:80.0%;" alt="image" /> <span id="fig:comparison" label="fig:comparison"></span>
<figcaption>Figure 3. When the length of the cell side is $1$, the weighted lengths of $ \mathit{SP_w}(s,t) $, blue, and $ \mathit{SGP_w}(s,t) $, red, are respectively 11.26 and 12.</figcaption>
</figure>

As main results on this research line, the mentioned thesis provided the
following bounds for the ratio
$\frac{\lVert \mathit{SGP_w}(s,t)\rVert}{\lVert \mathit{SP_w}(s,t)\rVert}$:  
It is at most $\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \approx 1.15$,
$\frac{2}{\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2}}} \approx 1.08$ and
$\frac{2}{\sqrt{2+\sqrt{3}}} \approx 1.04$ in an equilateral-triangle, a
square and a regular-hexagon mesh, respectively. These bounds provide a
theoretical justification for practical applications using shortest
paths computed on a regular mesh, since they guarantee approximation
errors of at most $15\%$, $8\%$ or $4\%$, depending on the type of mesh
used.

Finally, let us mention a very surprising and counter-intuitive finding:
These worst-case upper bounds are independent of the particular
assignment of weights to the regions in the tessellation. That is, the
same bounds hold no matter whether some regions have a cost much higher
than the others (independently of how many are they), or all the regions
have the same cost (independently of how high this is).
