Richard Montgomery was one of the ten recipients of the prestigious
European Mathematical Society (EMS) prize, given in during the
9<sup>th</sup> European Congress of Mathematics, in Sevilla.
This prize is awarded every four years by the EMS to
mathematicians under the age of 35 in recognition of exceptional
contributions to mathematics. His award announcement credits him for
*his solution of the Ringel tree packing conjecture, development
of distributive absorption techniques with applications to graph
embedding problems, and resolution of several classical conjectures of
Erdős and others on cycle lengths in sparse graphs using the novel
machinery of sublinear expanders.* Let us briefly describe some of these
achievements.

A typical decomposition question asks whether the edges of some graph
$G$ can be partitioned into disjoint copies of another
graph $H$ &mdash; in which case we say that
$H$ **packs** into $G$. One of the oldest and best known
conjectures in this area, posed by Ringel in 1963, concerns the
decomposition of complete graphs into edge-disjoint copies of
a tree. It says that every tree with $n$ edges packs
$2n+1$ times into the complete graph $K_{2n+1}$. 
The earliest result about spanning tree decompositions is perhaps due
to Walecki (1882), who showed that complete graphs on
$2n$ vertices can be decomposed into spanning paths. After this,
a number of increasingly sophisticated approaches, often using
probabilistic techniques and the Regularity method, confirmed the
decomposition for relaxations of the problem (such as considering
specific classes of trees or approximate decompositions).
Finally, in 2021, Alexey Pokrovskiy, Richard Montgomery and Benny
Sudakov solved Ringel's conjecture for all sufficiently large
cliques. Their argument involves, among many others, the absorption
method (introduced by Röodl, Ruciński and
Szemerédi  [[5]](#rodl2006dirac)). This method plays an essential role in
modern combinatorics, lying at the heart of breakthroughs such as
Keevash's proof of the existence of designs.


Another major contribution of Montgomery is, incidentally, the
development of a particular type absorption technique, known
as \emph{distributive absorption} (see, e.g., [[3](#montgomery2024transversals), Section 5]). Absorption, roughly speaking,
is a general name given to strategies for decomposing a large
object $O$: firstly, one reserves a small substructure
of $O$ that has some flexibility in it; on a second step, the
leftover structure is nearly completely decomposed; finally, the
flexibility of the initially reserved structure is used to convert the
approximate decomposition into a perfect one.
Absorbers are often built using a combination of probabilistic and structural
methods, and we shall not attempt to give details here (instead we refer the
interested reader to the Montgomery's survey article [[3](#montgomery2024transversals), Section 5]).

Distributive absorption was developed by Montgomery in 2019, in an article
confirming a conjecture of Kahn [[2]](#montgomery2019spanning) about spanning
trees of the binomial random graph $G(n,p)$. More precisely, he proved that
for each $\Delta > 0$ there exists $C=C(\Delta)$ such that $G(n,C\log n/n)$
almost surely contains a copy of every tree with $n$ vertices and maximum
degree at most $\Delta$. 


We conclude this brief account by stating some ground-breaking progress
obtained by Montgomery and collaborators on an old problem of Erdős.
In 1975, Erdős os asked what is the maximum number of edges that an
$n$-vertex graph can have if it does not contain two edge-disjoint
cycles on the same vertex set. Untill recently, the best known lower and
upper bounds were, respectively, $\Omega(n\log\log n)$ and $\Omega(n^{3/2})$.
Recently, Debsoumya Chakraborti, Oliver Janzer, Abhishek Methuku, and Richard Montgomery 
obtained an upper bound of order $n\cdot \mathrm{polylog} (n)$,
closing the problem up to the polylog term. Their proof combines a number
of novel methods, and an approach to regularizing sparse graphs that might
find applications in a number of related problems.

Altogether, the contributions mentioned above are but a small sample of many
impressive contributions of Richard Montgomery to Mathematics, certainly
worthy of wide recognition!
