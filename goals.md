title: Goals
---
The main aim of the Network is to coordinate the research groups in the area of Discrete Matematics at a national level. This objective is achieved through the following:

- Providing a stable framework for the organization of the biennial *Discrete Mathematics Days* conference and strengthening its identity and visibility to position it at the level of similar international conferences.
- Organizing training programs such as schools, advanced courses, and other formats to provide solid training for young researchers.
- Promoting the exchange of doctoral students and postdoctoral fellows among research groups to provide training for young researchers at the national level.
- Encouraging collaboration between research groups by providing stable sources of mobility and reinforcing their bonds.
- Promoting the development of ambitious research programs that can benefit from the different specializations of the research groups integrated into the Network.
- Creating opportunities for participation in national and international research projects.
- Facilitating and promoting participation in various research activities organized by different research groups, advanced schools, workshops, conferences, etc.
- Promoting and facilitating international mobility for researchers who conduct stays in Spanish research groups within the Network.
- Establishing a platform for relationships with numerous researchers in the field who carry out their professional activities in universities and research centers outside of Spain.
- Establishing stable relationships with similar organizations at the international level. In the medium term, promoting a European network of discrete and algorithmic mathematics that can extend the scope of the objectives proposed in this Network at the European level.
- Promoting the participation of the field of discrete and algorithmic mathematics in interdisciplinary scientific and technological meetings, such as those organized by the *Real Sociedad Espa침ola de Matem치ticas* or the *Sociedad Espa침ola de Matem치tica Aplicada*, among others.
- Promoting outreach activities on social media to contribute to public awareness of the role of science and technology. In particular, promoting the dissemination of discrete and algorithmic mathematics in secondary education and contributing to fostering vocations in science and technology among young people.
- Promoting the participation of women in research in an highly attractive area where gender parity is still far from being achieved.
