## 2024

**[BGSMath Advanced Course: Threshold phenomena in random structures]()**, Centre de Recerca Matemàtica - Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, November 11-22, 2024.\
The course will present the notion of threshold, a phenomenon consisting on a sudden behavioural change in the random structure produced by a small increase of the modelling parameter (temperature, energy, probability, ... ). We will survey the most recent advances in the area as well as explore applications in other fields such as Sociology, Biology, Statistics and Computer Science. The last part of the course will be devoted to covering two very recent breakthroughs in the area: (1) the Kahn-Kalai conjecture, now Park-Pham theorem, asserting that thresholds can not differ too much from expected thresholds [10]. We plan to give a full proof of it; and (2) The satisfiability conjecture, now the Ding-Sly-Sun theorem, that pins down the thresh- old for a random k-SAT formula being satisfiable. The course is aimed at master and doctoral students, and at postdoctoral researchers in the areas of Mathematics, Computer Science and Physics, but is also open to all early career researchers and faculty in other areas that are interested in the fundamentals of threshold phenomena and its applications to different disciplines.
