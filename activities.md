## 2024


**[Combinatorial Designs and Codes (CODESCO’24)](https://gestioneventos.us.es/codesco24)**, Sevilla, July 8-12, 2024.\
The goal of the conference is to bring together researchers interested in combinatorial design theory, coding theory, graph theory, algebraic combinatorics and finite geometry, with particular emphasis on establishing new synergies among them, and new applications to other fields and to the real world, including artificial intelligence, communication networks, cryptography and machine learning. The conference is a satellite event of the [9th European Congress of Mathematics](https://www.ecm2024sevilla.com).
 


**[Discrete Mathematics Days 2024](https://dmd2024.web.uah.es/)**, Alcalá de Henares, July 3-5, 2024.\
The Discrete Mathematics Days (DMD 2024) will be held on July 3-5, 2024, at the Universidad de Alcalá, in Alcalá de Henares (Spain). The main focus of this international conference is on current topics in Discrete Mathematics. Known as Discrete Mathematics Days since 2016, this conference inherits the tradition of the Jornadas de Matemática Discreta y Algorítmica (JMDA), the Spanish biennial meeting on Discrete Mathematics started in 1998. The program consists consist of four plenary talks, a number of shorter contributed talks in two parallel sessions, and a poster session. The plenary speakers are:
[Julia Böttcher](https://www.lse.ac.uk/Mathematics/people/Julia-Boettcher) (London School of Economics), [Irit Dinur](https://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~dinuri/) (Weizmann Institute), [Arnau Padrol](https://www.ub.edu/comb/arnaupadrol/) (Universitat de Barcelona) and [Alex Scott](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/scott/) (University of Oxford). The [Ramon Llull prize on Discrete Mathematics](/ramon-llull) will be awarded during the conference.

**[Congreso Biennal RSME](https://2024.bienalrsme.com/sesiones-especiales)**, Pamplona, January 22-26, 2024.\
Special Session devoted to 'Discrete and Algorithmic Mathematics' within the Congreso Bienal de la Real Sociedad Matemática Española (RSME) 2024. The invited speakers of the session are: Maria Bras-Amorós (U. Rovira i Virgili), Simon Briend (U. Pompeu Fabra), Pablo Candela (U. Autònoma Madrid), Pedro A. García-Sánchez (U. Granada), Delia Garijo (U. Sevilla), María Ángeles Hernández Cifre (U. Murcia), Kolja Knauer (U. Barcelona), Julio J. Moyano-Fernández (U. Jaume I), Marc Noy (U. Politècnica Catalunya), Mariana Rosas-Ribeiro (U. Rovira i Virgili), Francisco Santos (U. Cantabria). The session is organised by Delia Garijo, Marc Noy and Francisco Santos.

**[Santander Workshop on Geometric and Algebraic Combinatorics](https://gacsantander2024.unican.es/)**, Santander, January 15-19, 2024.\
The Santander Workshop on Geometric and Algebraic Combinatorics will have a hybrid format of mini-courses and invited lectures, plus contributions from participants. The workshop will take place at Universidad de Cantabria in Santander, Spain. It is partially funded by the Spanish Research Agency and the Bank of Santander.


## 2023

**[Encuentro andaluz de Matemática Discreta 2024](https://xiiieamd.uca.es/)**, Cádiz, July 5-7, 2023.\
The 13th edition of the Encuentro Andaluz de Matemática Discreta takes place in Cádiz, organized by the Departments of Mathemtaics and Statistics and OR. 

**[XX Spanish Meeting on Computational Geometry](https://egc23.web.uah.es/)**, Santiago de Compostela,  July 3-5, 2023\
The XX Spanish Meeting on Computational Geometry took place from July 3 to 5, 2023, at Universidad de Santiago de Compostela, Santiago de Compostela, Spain. The core of this international conference is composed by the most current issues in the field of Discrete and Computational Geometry, both in its theoretical and applied aspects. The EGC series began in 1990. 


## 2022

**[Discrete Mathematics Days 2022](https://dmd2022.unican.es/index.html)**, Santander, July 4-6, 2022.\
The Discrete Mathematics Days (DMD20/22) will be held on July 4-6, 2022, at Facultad de Ciencias of the Universidad de Cantabria (Santander, Spain). The main focus of this international conference is on current topics in Discrete Mathematics. The previous editions were held in Sevilla in 2018 and in Barcelona in 2016, inheriting the tradition of the Jornadas de Matemática Discreta y Algorítmica (JMDA), the Spanish biennial meeting (since 1998) on Discrete Mathematics.
