# Discrete and algorithmic mathematics Spanish network

Discrete and algorithmic mathematics is an area of mathematics that studies combinatorial and geometric discrete structures, in particular graphs and networks, finite geometries, discrete geometrical structures and combinatorial aspects in algebra and number theory, including their computational and algorithmic aspects, which arise from the natural connection of discrete mathematics with computer science. The tools coming from analytic, topological, algebraic, geometric and probabilistic methods as well as its wide range of applications in computer science, information theory, coding theory, statistics, physics, biology and social sciences makes discrete mathematics a genuine interdisciplinary area both within mathematics and in science and technology.

The main objectives of the Network are to foster cooperation among the existing groups in the area in Spain, reinforcing their scientific collaboration, coordinating scientific activities, training of young researchers, to reinforce the participation of female researchers, to increase the international visibility of the research in Discrete Mathematics in Spain and promoting outreach activities for the social awareness of science and technology with particular focus on Discrete Mathematics.
