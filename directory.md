This webpage contains a non-exhaustive a list of research groups in Discrete Mathematics and related areas that are based in Spain, and is continuously under construction. If you are member of a group or you are a researcher in Spain, in a related area related and would like to appear in this directory, please send an email to guillem.perarnau@upc.edu.
