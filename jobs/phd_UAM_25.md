**Beca doctoral FPI en la UAM**

*Name of the project*: Arithmetic Combinatorics and Analysis

*Summary*: This PhD project, to be carried out at the Autonomous 
University of Madrid (UAM), evolves at the interface between analysis 
and combinatorics, and offers various possible lines of research, 
especially within the broad area of arithmetic combinatorics and its 
ramifications in analysis. Possible topics include the following:

- higher-order Fourier analysis, its theoretical development 
(particularly in connection with the rapidly growing theory of 
nilspaces) as well as its recent quantitative or algorithmic progress.

- questions in ergodic theory related to higher-order Fourier analysis 
or to arithmetic and combinatorial problems (e.g. the structural 
analysis of Host-Kra factors and its applications, connections between 
ergodic theory and tiling or packing questions, Motzkin's problem, etc.)

- questions in arithmetic combinatorics (e.g. the 3k-4 problem in 
cyclic groups of prime order, applications of entropy in arithmetic 
combinatorics, quantitative quadratic Fourier analysis and its 
number-theoretic applications, and miscellaneous other questions).


*PI*: Pablo Candela (pablo.candela@icmat.es). Any interested 
potential candidate is welcome to contact the advisor directly at 
their earliest convenience, to obtain more information on the PhD 
program at the UAM and on the application process, which is expected 
to begin in **November 2025**.

*Candidate's Profile*: The PhD researcher is expected to work on topics in the aforementioned directions. The interested candidates are encouraged to discuss more 
specific topics informally with the PhD advisor soon, prior to their 
formal application to the PhD program.

*Deadline*: **TBD**
