**Plaza predoctoral en la Universidad Politècnica de Catalunya en Combinatoria**

*Nombre del proyecto:* COntemporary COmbinatorics and Applications (COCOA)

*Breve descripción:* Combinatorics is a broad discipline in the forefront of modern mathematics extending its influence across many other scientific fields. This proposal explores a wide variety of its applications, both of purely mathematical nature and delving into the realm of complex systems such as the world-wide web, sociology, telecommunication, and quantum computation. Approaches to combinatorial problems are inherently diverse, encompassing algebraic, analytic, geometric and probabilistic tools. The combined expertise of the team in these methods is the identity mark of our research group and will allow us to address open problems and new trends in the area.

*IP(s):* Simeon Ball (simeon.michael.ball@upc.edu) y Guillem Perarnau (guillem.perarnau@upc.edu)

*Perfil del candidato:* We are looking for motivated candidates with a strong background in combinatorics, who would like to work on its interactions with geometry, analysis, number theory or probability.

*Deadline*: **25th November 2024**
