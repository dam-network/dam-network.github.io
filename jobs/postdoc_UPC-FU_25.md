**3-Year Joint Postdoctoral Position at Universitat Politècnica Catalunya and Freie Universität Berlin**


A three-year postdoctoral position will be available within the bilateral DFG+AEI project «SRC-ExCo-Structure, Randomness and Computational Methods in Extremal Combinatorics» between the Combinatorics and Graph Theory research group at the Freie Universität Berlin and the Geometric, Algebraic and Probabilisitc Combinatorics group at Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (Barcelona, Spain). The project is lead by Tibor Szabó (FU Berlin node) and Juanjo Rué (UPC node).

The successful candidate will undertake the initial 18 months of the postdoctoral research at UPC. Pending a positive midterm evaluation, the postdoctoral position will be followed by the subsequent 18 months at FU Berlin.

The successful candidate should hold a PhD in mathematics or related field by the start of the appointment and have an interest in extremal and probabilistic combinatorics or graph theory. The successful candidate will have the opportunity to interact in Barcelona with researchers of the project, including Patrick Morris, Simeon Ball, Guillem Perarnau and Richard Lang.

The position is to be filled by September 2025 the latest, but an earlier starting date is also possible.

*Documentation*: Qualified candidates should submit
    • a cover letter, including the name of at least two reference letter writers.
    • CV, including list of publications,
    • research statement
Please send these three documents in a single pdf-file to Juanjo Rué at juan.jose.rue@upc.edu.

Additionally, at least two letters of recommendation should be sent directly by the reference writers to juan.jose.rue@upc.edu.

*Deadline for applications*: Applications received by **27th of January 2025** will receive full consideration. Any question may be addressed to juan.jose.rue@upc.edu by the date of the deadline.

*About UPC*: The Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC Barcelona) is a top public university in Spain specializing in engineering, architecture, and science. Founded in 1971, UPC is known for its excellence in technology and innovation. The Department of Mathematics at UPC plays a central role in mathematics in the Barcelona region, and many of their members are associated researchers at Centre de Recerca Matemàtica (www.crm.cat). Combinatorics is a well stablished topic in Barcelona with a large research group that had grown in the last years.

*About FU Berlin*: The Freie Universität Berlin is part of the Berlin University Allience, one of the "Universities of Excellence" of Germany. The Mathematics Institute is a core member of the Berlin Mathematical School (http://www.math-berlin.de/), a joint English-language graduate program, established in cooperation with the other two major research universities of Berlin (the Humboldt-Universität (HU) and the Technische Universität (TU)). Discrete Mathematics is represented in great variety in Berlin and is one of the focus areas of the BMS.  The city of Berlin has a great tradition of multicultural openness and its rich cultural and academic life also provides an excellent setting for mathematical exploration.
