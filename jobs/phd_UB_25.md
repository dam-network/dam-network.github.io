**PhD Position in Discrete Geometry**


The Discrete Geometry group at Goethe University Frankfurt, led by Prof. Dr.
Raman Sanyal, is looking for a **PhD student** (m/f/d) to join our research project
**"Combinatorial Polytope Theory"** (COMPOTE).  This is a 3-year position (E13 TV-L,
75%), starting June 1, 2025 (negotiable, but no later than September 1, 2025).
COMPOTE is a Spanish-German collaboration funded by Deutsche   
Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) and Agencia Estatal de investigación (AEI),
focusing on the combinatorics of polytopes. The successful candidate will work
closely with Prof. Arnau Padrol (Universitat de Barcelona) and will have
opportunities for research visits to Barcelona. More details can be found
here https://www.ub.edu/comb/compote

*Requirements:*
- Master's degree (or equivalent) in mathematics or a closely related field
- Background (or strong motivation to learn) in geometric combinatorics
  (polytopes, polyhedral subdivisions, oriented matroids)
- Interest in computer-aided exploration is a plus
- Good English skills (written & spoken)
- Independent work style & ability to collaborate in a team

*We offer:*
- A funded 3-year PhD position (E13 TV-L, 75%) including the usual benefits of a
