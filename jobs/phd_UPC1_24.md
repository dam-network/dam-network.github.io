**Plaza predoctoral en la Universidad Politècnica de Catalunya en Geometría Computacional**

*Nombre del proyecto*: Geometric and Abstract Graphs: Theory and Applications

*Breve descripción*: This project aims to advance the theoretical foundations in and at the intersection of geometric graphs and abstract graphs, as well as linking such theoretical insights to applications. The starting hypothesis is that there is considerable uncharted terrain in theoretical and applied aspects at the intersection of Computational Geometry and Graph Theory and Algorithms, in particular regarding geometric graphs. To tackle cutting-edge problems in this unexplored territory, we need to combine and develop new insights and techniques in both areas. The PhD position is expected to work on two main research lines. The first one, more theoretical, focuses on combinatorial and algorithmic questions in geometric graphs. Considering simultaneously the graph information and the geometry of the embeddings makes many tools from abstract graphs not directly applicable, but it also opens the door to use geometric insights. The second line is of a more applied nature, aiming at bringing the deep understanding of geometric and abstract graphs present in the research team to concrete problems in robot reconfiguration and geographic information analysis.

*IP(s)*: Irene Parada (irene.parada@upc.edu) and Rodrigo Silveira (rodrigo.silveira@upc.edu)

*Perfil del candidato*: Since the research focus of the PhD position is on geometric graph algorithms, a strong background in discrete mathematics or theoretical computer science is ideal.

*Deadline*: **25th November 2024**
